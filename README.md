I’m a developer who defies the laws of physics by writing code without a single drop of coffee in my system. I run on pure chaos, hydration, and the frantic energy of my Shih-Tzu. If I can debug a **Rust** borrow-checker error or optimize a **serverless function** without caffeine, I can do anything.

👥 **Pronouns**: I'm a he/him, but when the mood is right, I identify as a Michael Jackson. ***he/he!***
> I spent way too much time thinking of this joke 🤡

### 🕹 Current Quest: [toy-engine](https://github.com/halkliff/toy-engine)
I am currently deep in the rabbit hole of **Game Engine Development**. 
* **The Goal:** Building a renderer, ECS, Editor, and a literal C# integration for scripting from scratch because I enjoy pain (mentally).
* **The Status:** It hasn't achieved sentience yet, but the triangles are starting to look weird.
  > _And last I checked, the quaternions too._

### 📂 The Archive: Machine Learning & LLMOps goodies
Before I started obsessing over game loops, I spent years talking to matrices.
* **Time-space Continuum**: 8+ years of professional XP (11+ if you count the years I spent making the computer beep for fun)
* **High-Level Quests:** Spearheaded tools and AI features for names like **Rivian**, using **Amazon Bedrock** and **GraphQL**.
* **Past Obsession:** Training models to do things humans probably could have done faster, but with more **Python**.
* **Transition:** I still love ML—now I'm just figuring out how to bake those "big brain" neural networks into real-time environments.
  > _Possibly the reason the triangles are looking weird, but oh well..._

### 🐾 The "Real" Manager: My Shih-Tzu Cleo
I am currently being supervised by a tiny, fluffy living paradox.
* **High Energy:** Her `learning_rate` is set way too high. She zooms at 1000fps.
* **Low Bravery:** Terrified of her own shadow, the wind, and probably my code. She has a very high `false_positive` rate for "danger."
* **Role:** Chief Emotional Support Officer & Professional Distractor.
  > If I don't commit code, I don't get to give treats. It's a strict management style.

### ☕ The "Hot" Take
**Public Service Announcement:** I don't drink coffee. I am a software engineer powered entirely by 8 hours of sleep (ideally). It turns out you *can* understand **backpropagation** and **memory management** while being fully hydrated.
> No, I am not a robot (though my lack of caffeine dependency suggests otherwise). I’m powered by the satisfaction of a passing test suite and a very loud gaming keyboard.

### 🔮 Main Quest: What’s Next? 
I’m looking for a "Party" (a.k.a. a team) where I can:
* **Level Up:** Combine my love for ML, Game Tech, and high-performance **Rust/TS**.
* **Loot:** Work on projects that solve complex problems with elegant code.
* **Co-op:** Join a team that appreciates a well-placed meme and dog photos in Slack.

*"I’m proof that you can reach 120% CPU usage on water alone; mostly because I found a new game engine rabbit hole and my brain refuses to look away."*
